===========
Added replicate labels as a "Sample" factor in the soilrep dataset.

phyloseq 1.1.17
===========
Fix possible bug that results from the latest version (0.6+) of igraph not being backward compatible. A stable igraph0 package is available on CRAN as a stop-gap, and so all igraph dependencies were migrated to "igraph0" until the phyloseq-source can be updated to match the igraph latest.

phyloseq 1.1.15
===========
plot_heatmap: Added default (but adjustable) threshold to omit taxa/sample labels

phyloseq 1.1.14

* Updated variable names and doc for the plot_taxa_bar() function

phyloseq 1.1.6
===========
* Update vignette with plot_tree() example, replacing the 
   old base-graphics function, plot_tree_phyloseq().

  to internal methods in v0.99.42
* Modify make_sample_network to use the new distance() function, and be able to pass on
  additional parameters to distance().
* Re-order arguments to make_sample_network to better represent the stability of defaults.
* Removed redundant parameters from make_sample_network(). Transformations to abundance
  tables should be performed upstream using phyloseq tools, not embedded in this function.
* Modify vignettes to reflect these changes.
* Rebuild vignette.
* Update import() documentation to reflect support for BIOM format, import_biom() function.

v0.99.43
===========

  https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/68
