phyloseq 1.3.23 - bug fix for transform_sample_counts
===========
Only appears to affect OTU tables in the "taxa are columns" orientation.
It is the result of a surprising behavior of the apply() function,
which in this circumstance transposes the table.

phyloseq 1.3.22 - additional tests for prun_*() and phyloseq() functions
===========
Before releasing v1.3.21 on GitHub:master some gaps in re-order checking were noticed. 
These are now caught by new unit tests and phyloseq/prune/etc have been further revised to ensure that properly-ordered OTUs are not disordered during a pruning step.

phyloseq 1.3.21 - accessor efficiency
===========
For instance, ntaxa() and taxa_names() are very slow on large dataset
Some of the highly inefficient approaches are now replaced. 
The strategy is described further in the related GitHub issue:
https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/183


phyloseq 1.3.20 - reference sequence class update.
===========
- formally define the new version of phyloseq-class with refseq slot included
- new/augmented accessors:
	- taxa_names
	- ntaxa
	- refseq
- phyloseq() constructor now supports XStringSet components
- reconcile_species internal function removed/replaced
	- reconcile_species removed from constructor and package. internal, so no need to deprecate.
- check the component slot list provided by the "splat" infrastructure
- prune_taxa
- Rebuild current example data.
- print/show methods. 
- subset_taxa
- add refseq (XStringSet) object argument to import functions.
	- import_qiime
	- import_biom
- merge_phyloseq
	- works with refseq data
- Add merge_taxa method for XStringSet objects
- Include reference sequences in example datasets
Additional improvements included in version:
- prune_* / reconcile_* / intersect_*
	- add intersect_samples() function, model after new version of intersect_species()
	- rename intersect_species to intersect_taxa()
	- rm/replace reconcile_* functions with prune_*(intersect_*(), ps).
	- These changes make simpler / DRYer code. Easier to extend.
- DRY (and hopefully speed) improvements to merge_taxa()
	- Additional speed improvements may be possible for tip_glom, tax_glom in later revisions


phyloseq 1.3.14
===========
- Shortened/replaced examples in the longest-running doc examples.
  This substantially reduces the time it takes to run package checks.

- Focused on worst offenders

- Created a new online tutorial for `subset_ord_plot`. 
  Linked to it from `plot_ordination`

- `plot_taxa_bar` moved to deprecated function file where it belongs,
   and examples completely removed from doc.


phyloseq 1.3.13
===========
- Fixed unofficial warning from missing (unregistered) classes 
  of ordination objects. Stems from the internal get_eigenvalue
  being defined as S4 generic instead of S3.
Solves the following logged issue:
https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/166

- Name of get_eigenvalue generic replaced with extract_eigenvalue,
  in addition to re-defining as S3 generic. 

- Fixed ggplot2 warning from over-specified "bins" in the
  plot_scree bar plot. Changed to stat="identity", solves problem

- Fixed warning when eigenvalues get (slightly) negative. They
  are now set to 0.0 for the purposes of plotting in plot_scree.

phyloseq 1.3.12
===========
- Fixed a parsing issue for some QIIME-produced .biom files
  that had leading space characters. Issue further described at
https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/171
  Fixed such that any number of leading/lagging space characters
  are removed from taxonomic classification entries

- Fixed build issue on some windows machines derived from problem
  with figure files having colons in the filename.

phyloseq 1.3.11
===========
- Added tree option for import_biom() importer so that users can avoid
  using merge_phyloseq() if their files are otherwise standard vanilla
- Address Issue 169 and 167
https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/169
https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/167

phyloseq 1.3.10
===========
- Added support for Shannon/Simpson alpha-diversity indices in plot_richness
  https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/164

- All sample_data now embedded in plot_richness output graphic, in case want 
  to use other covariates in additional layers not originally specified.
  For instance, if you wanted to include geom_text(label=addLayer1).
  See plot_richness online tutorial.

phyloseq 1.3.9
===========
- Added ability to add node labels, bootstrap values to tree graphics
  generated by plot_tree.
- The labeling itself is opened-up as a user-provided function to facilitate
  custom node-labeling needs (including symbols and other ggplot2 geoms)
- Commonly-needed functions are provided as newly-documented exported 
  functions in the package:
nodeplotdefault - adds whatever is in the node label to the graphic
nodeplotboot - Adds the labels as bootstrap values, coercing/rounding as needed
nodeplotblank - Ensures that node labels are not added.
- These new functions can be used to give valid arguments to the new
  `nodelabf` argument in plot_tree().
- Some other re-organization to plot_tree to show more code in 
  the main plot_tree function.

phyloseq 1.3.8
===========
- Fix bug in plot_tree graphic if sample names start with a number
- This fixes https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/149
- Also added fill argument to default aesthetic map definition, useful if fillable shapes defined in subsequent layers

phyloseq 1.3.7
===========
- Revisions to plot_tree to improve formatting, organization, "ladderize"
	- contributed by Gregory Jordan
- Color scale option removed from original pull request
	- already supported as core ggplot2 functionality through layering
- Added links and roxygen2-header revisions for proper doc formatting
- Fixed bug in which alternative size-variables still labeled as "abundance" in legend.

phyloseq 1.3.6
===========
- Updated basics vignette

phyloseq 1.3.5
===========
- Updated README.md to point to phyloseq home page (instead of redundant display of content). 
- Also added README.html

phyloseq 1.3.4
===========
- Updated tests, examples for merge_samples()
- Updated some dependency min versions
- First 2013 commit

phyloseq 1.3.3
===========

- modular building of taxonomy table in import_qiime() and import_biom()

phyloseq 1.3.2
===========
- import_biom() fixes.
	- More robust data handling for taxonomy table
	- Flexibility: Can take custom parsing function for taxonomy vectors
	- tests added for new parsing functions
		- parse_taxonomy_default
		- parse_taxonomy_greengenes

phyloseq 1.3.1
===========
- New function: plot_bar() that is simpler more reliable than plot_taxa_bar.
- plot_taxa_bar now deprecated.
	- labeled deprecated in title doc
	- replaced examples in vignette with plot_bar examples

phyloseq 1.3.0
===========
- Level up github devel version number to reflect devel order/status relative to latest BioC release


phyloseq 1.1.58
===========
- Fixed a bug in import_qiime in which import fails if there are any empty taxonomy string fields in a file that otherwise has some taxonomic assignments. Now the taxonomy entries for that OTU (row in the taxonomy table) are left all NA_character_ by default.

phyloseq 1.1.57
===========
- Added automatic removal of single and double quotes from phylogenetic tree tip names provided to the phyloseq-constructor. This should help avoid problems importing data that includes a tree, for the cases where the taxa/OTU names don't match because of these extra quotation marks. Added directly into the phyloseq() constructor, so that it doesn't matter how/where the tree was imported/add.
- Removal of quotes is only initiated when OTU/taxa names fail to match AT ALL
(intersection is length zero) between component taxa names. 
- This feature needs to be added to unit tests as well.

phyloseq 1.1.55
===========
- Added "title" argument to plot_scree() and plot_ordination(â€¦, type="scree"), for consistency.

phyloseq 1.1.54
===========
- Changed "species" label in different plot_ordination() graphics to "taxa"
- Fixed an issue with a default parameter in a related internal function
	(changed "samples" to "sites" for vegan compatibility).

phyloseq 1.1.53
===========
- Fixed additional title issues in plot_network and plot_richness

phyloseq 1.1.52
===========
- Added plot_scree() function for making eigenvalue "scree" plots in ggplot2
- Added corresponding type="scree" option to plot_ordination, for convenience.

phyloseq 1.1.51
===========
- Returned to "Imports:" dependency for ggplot2 following a ggplot2 bug fix

phyloseq 1.1.50
===========
- Fixed several compatibility issues to support latest version of ggplot2 (0.9.2).
- Also changes plot_richness_estimates() to plot_richness().

phyloseq 1.1.45
===========
- Backward compatibility for import_qiime_sampleData,
  now superseded by import_qiime_sample_data
- Added a functioning example based on the GlobalPatterns
  example sample-map file included in the package extdata.

phyloseq 1.1.44
===========
- Fixed minor bug in tax_glom function.
Thanks to Katie Shelef for the bug report. Bug only affected tax_glom behavior when the right-most rank was specified as the position for merging.

phyloseq 1.1.43
===========
- fixed distance() issue from species/taxa replacement for type argument.

phyloseq 1.1.42
===========
- fixed make_network/plot_network issue from species/taxa replacement for type argument.

phyloseq 1.1.41
===========
- Fixed documentation for `prune_taxa` and `prune_samples`
- Updated `prune_samples` method to allow for logical vectors.
- Fixed `prune_taxa` so that it properly fails with a message if the taxa argument is a logical of wrong length.
   There was some potential (and no warning) for unpredictable vector-recycling
   with short vectors in the old implementation.

phyloseq 1.1.40
===========
## Huge Update and Renaming Event.
- Made all functions use an *underscore* for English word delimiter, if they were using an abbreviation. 
- Replaced "species" in all function names with "taxa". 
- These changes are all backward compatible, for now, so your old code should work. Let me know if it doesn't and I will quickly make the adjustment. This will remain true through the next official release,
but functional references to "species" will not be supported afterward,
except in the occasions where you actually mean taxonomic species, like `tax_glom(x, "species")`.

phyloseq 1.1.33
===========
Revise taxglom() such that it handles phyloseq and taxonomyTable classes,
throws warning otherwise. It should not take a manually-produced character
vector, as this is roughly equivalent to functionality supported in other method,
especially prune_species()/merge_species().
Also added unit-tests and executable examples for taxglom().
Got rid of taxglom.internal, incorporated directly into taxglom().
taxglom() is no longer an S4-method, and 
doesn't need to be now that the character-vector argument option is omitted,
with S4-class handling delegated to merge_species().
Updated "taxTab<-" to be S4 assignment, clearer handling of taxonomy Table assignments,
especially useful for taxglom.

phyloseq 1.1.29
===========
Add unit tests and example files for import_biom (as well as import("biom",...) ).

phyloseq 1.1.28
===========
Added rarefy_even_depth() function for random subsampling of microbiome samples to the same number of reads. Default uses the minimum total reads among the samples in the dataset. This is based on the core "sample" function, which can have its random number generator fixed by set.seed for reproducibility.

phyloseq 1.1.27
===========
Fix bug in plot_ordination that caused an error rather than produce unannotated plots when sampleData absent in the input.

phyloseq 1.1.23-26
===========
Added unit tests and bugfixes

phyloseq 1.1.19-22
===========
Improving import_qiime() importer to handle large datasets,
like the HMPv35 dataset, for example, while also providing useful status messages
during non-trivial imports that might take 10 minutes or more to complete.

phyloseq 1.1.18
===========
Added replicate labels as a "Sample" factor in the soilrep dataset.

phyloseq 1.1.17
===========
Fix possible bug that results from the latest version (0.6+) of igraph not being backward compatible. A stable igraph0 package is available on CRAN as a stop-gap, and so all igraph dependencies were migrated to "igraph0" until the phyloseq-source can be updated to match the igraph latest.

phyloseq 1.1.15
===========
plot_heatmap: Added default (but adjustable) threshold to omit taxa/sample labels

phyloseq 1.1.14
===========
Update import_qiime() function to import latest non-BIOM qiime output files.
