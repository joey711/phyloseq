CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.5
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  - Help avoid cryptic errors due to name collision of `distance` with external loaded packages by making `distance` a formal S4 method in phyloseq.
  - Improve documentation of `distance` function and the downstream procedures on which it depends
  - Migrate the list of supported methods to a documented, exported list object, called `distanceMethodList`.
  - Improved distance unit tests with detailed checks that dispatch works and gives exactly expected distance matrices for all methods defined in distanceMethodList.
  - Improved JSD doc, performance, code, deprecated unnecessary `parallel` argument in JSD


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.4
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

  - `psmelt` bug if user has also loaded the original "reshape" package, due to name collision on the function called `melt`. `psmelt` now explicitly calls `reshape2::melt` to avoid confusion. https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/pull/489
  
  - Fix following note... There are ::: calls to the package's namespace in its code. A package almost never needs to use ::: for its own objects: ‘JSD.pair’

-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Fixed typo-derived bug in new vignette.

	- These changes allow user to build from source without error.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.8
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Package dependencies reduced/clarified:
		https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/259
		Should reduce chances for collisions with other packages, and related issues.
		Removed any dependencies on the picante package.

	- Replaced picante::node.age() with a faster implementation, node_ages()
		Appears to be 3 times faster.
		Speeds up UniFrac() and tip_glom() calculations.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.7
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Tree fixes:
		https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/235
		https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/255

	- If a tree has NA branch-length values, they are automatically set to 0.
		This occurs within both phyloseq(), and read_tree().

	- UniFrac calculations require a rooted tree. While a rooted tree is
		not required to be part of a phyloseq object, it is a helpful
		default behavior to select a random root when UniFrac is called
		and the tree is unrooted, flashing a notice to the user.
	
	- Precise import from ape-package, rather than full-import. 
		Smaller chance for collisions.
		Precisely-defined dependencies listed in NAMESPACE

	- As a result of the previous, phyloseq defines a placeholder "phylo" class,
		extended from "list". This seems to match the class
		from a full import of ape, and is necessary since ape does not
		export the "phylo" class.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.6

	- igraph is actively updated/maintained. igraph0 isn't / soon won't be.

	- The load bug that I could find from re-running the tutorial in the new dependency
	  had to do with accessing the vertex names. The appropriate function is:
	  `get.vertex.attribute`
	  which was not used previous, but is now imported and used in this version of phyloseq.

	- This also closes [Issue 247](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/247)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.22
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Fix minor bug in `import_mothur`

	- Bug occurs only when sample names are pure integers. One line fix.

	- This addresses [Issue 242](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/242) 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.21 
-------------------------

	- `plot_richness` / `estimate_richness` updates

	- Additional alpha-diversity measures added to both functions.
	
	- New argument, `measures`, added to both functions, allows user to 
	   specify which measures to calculate/display.

	- Also added unit tests for both functions, absent in prior versions


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.20 
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Bugfixes, `read_tree_greengenes`, and a `replace` optional parameter to rarefy_even_depth()

	- read_tree_greengenes() is a new function created specifically to address the problem
	   created when the greengenes consortium chose to publish their official release trees
	   with semicolon-delimited node labels, even though semicolons are also a special newick character.
	   The semicolons only appear when a node has more than one taxonomic rank assigned to it,
	   which is rare in the smaller (lower OTU similarity threshold) trees, but a big problem
	   in all the most commonly used trees, e.g. 97% tree. 
	   The hard part was identifying the precise cause of the problem. Now that it is precisely known,
	   the offending delimiters are temporarily replaced so that the standard parser `read.tree`
	   can create the phylo object, then they are reinstated. 
	   Unit tests have been added to check that this works properly on a GreenGenes release tree
	   that otherwise breaks `read.tree`.
	   This also solves 224
	   https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/224

	- Fixed a bug in which the highest taxonomic rank fails in `tax_glom`
	  This was a bug resulting from the automatic coercion of single-column
	  matrix subsetting to a vector. Simply changing the relevant line
	  of code in `tax_glom` such that [, , drop=FALSE],
	  solve this issue, Issue 223
	  https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/223
	  Unit tests have been added that should catch this in the future.

	- rarefy_even_depth() new option to sample without replacement.
	  Two implications to consider are that
	  (1) sampling with replacement is faster and more memory efficient
	  as currently implemented;
	  (2) sampling with replacement means that there is a chance that the
	  number of reads for a given OTU in a given sample could be larger
	  than the original count value. This is in contrast to sampling without replacement
	  where the original count value is the maximum possible.
	  Prior to this phyloseq version,
	  this `replace` parameter did not exist and sampling with replacement was the only
	  random subsampling implemented in the `rarefy_even_depth` function.
	  This prior behavior was selected for computational efficiency, but
	  differs from the behavior of analogous functions in related packages
	  (e.g. rarefying in QIIME).

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.19 
-------------------------

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.23 
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- bug fix for transform_sample_counts

	- Only appears to affect OTU tables in the "taxa are columns" orientation.
		It is the result of a surprising behavior of the apply() function,
		which in this circumstance transposes the table.

	- This solves a bug described in [Issue 186](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/186)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.22 
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- additional tests for prun_*() and phyloseq() functions

	- Before releasing v1.3.21 on GitHub:master some gaps in re-order checking were noticed. 
		These are now caught by new unit tests and phyloseq/prune/etc have been further revised to
 		ensure that properly-ordered OTUs are not disordered during a pruning step.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.21 
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- accessor efficiency
	
	- For instance, ntaxa() and taxa_names() are very slow on large dataset

-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Added ability to add node labels, bootstrap values to tree graphics
	  generated by plot_tree.

	- The labeling itself is opened-up as a user-provided function to facilitate
	  custom node-labeling needs (including symbols and other ggplot2 geoms)

	- Commonly-needed functions are provided as newly-documented exported 
	  functions in the package:
		nodeplotdefault - adds whatever is in the node label to the graphic
		nodeplotboot - Adds the labels as bootstrap values, coercing/rounding as needed
		nodeplotblank - Ensures that node labels are not added.

	- These new functions can be used to give valid arguments to the new
	  `nodelabf` argument in plot_tree().

	- Some other re-organization to plot_tree to show more code in 
	  the main plot_tree function.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.8

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.6
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Updated basics vignette

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.5
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Updated README.md to point to phyloseq home page (instead of redundant display of content). 
	
	- Also added README.html

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.4
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Updated tests, examples for merge_samples()

	- Updated some dependency min versions

	- First 2013 commit

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- updates to import_qiime()

	- modular building of taxonomy table in import_qiime() and import_biom()

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- import_biom() fixes.

	- More robust data handling for taxonomy table

	- Flexibility: Can take custom parsing function for taxonomy vectors

	- tests added for new parsing functions
		parse_taxonomy_default

	- plot_taxa_bar now deprecated.
	
	- labeled deprecated in title doc

	- replaced examples in vignette with plot_bar examples

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.0
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Level up github devel version number to reflect devel order/status relative to latest BioC release


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.58
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Fixed a bug in import_qiime in which import fails if there are any empty taxonomy 
		string fields in a file that otherwise has some taxonomic assignments. 
		Now the taxonomy entries for that OTU (row in the taxonomy table) are left all NA_character_ by default.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.57
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Added automatic removal of single and double quotes from phylogenetic tree tip names provided to the phyloseq-constructor.
		This should help avoid problems
	 	importing data that includes a tree, for the cases where the taxa/OTU names don't match because of these extra quotation marks. Added directly into the 
		phyloseq() constructor, so that it doesn't matter how/where the tree was imported/add.

	- Removal of quotes is only initiated when OTU/taxa names fail to match AT ALL
		(intersection is length zero) between component taxa names. 

	- This feature needs to be added to unit tests as well.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.55
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Added "title" argument to plot_scree() and plot_ordination(…, type="scree"), for consistency.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.54
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Changed "species" label in different plot_ordination() graphics to "taxa"

	- Fixed an issue with a default parameter in a related internal function
		(changed "samples" to "sites" for vegan compatibility).

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.53
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Fixed additional title issues in plot_network and plot_richness

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.52
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Added plot_scree() function for making eigenvalue "scree" plots in ggplot2

	- Added corresponding type="scree" option to plot_ordination, for convenience.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.51
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Returned to "Imports:" dependency for ggplot2 following a ggplot2 bug fix

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.50
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Fixed several compatibility issues to support latest version of ggplot2 (0.9.2).

	- Also changes plot_richness_estimates() to plot_richness().

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.45
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Backward compatibility for import_qiime_sampleData,
	  now superseded by import_qiime_sample_data

	- Added a functioning example based on the GlobalPatterns
	  example sample-map file included in the package extdata.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.44
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Fixed minor bug in tax_glom function.
	  Thanks to Katie Shelef for the bug report. Bug only affected tax_glom behavior when the
	  right-most rank was specified as the position for merging.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.43
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- fixed distance() issue from species/taxa replacement for type argument.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.42
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- fixed make_network/plot_network issue from species/taxa replacement for type argument.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.41
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Fixed documentation for `prune_taxa` and `prune_samples`

	- Updated `prune_samples` method to allow for logical vectors.

	- Fixed `prune_taxa` so that it properly fails with a message if the taxa argument is a logical of wrong length.
	   There was some potential (and no warning) for unpredictable vector-recycling
	   with short vectors in the old implementation.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.40
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Huge Update and Renaming Event.

	- Made all functions use an *underscore* for English word delimiter, if they were using an abbreviation. 

	- Replaced "species" in all function names with "taxa". 

	- These changes are all backward compatible, for now, so your old code should work. 
		Let me know if it doesn't and I will quickly make the adjustment. This will remain true through the next official release,
		but functional references to "species" will not be supported afterward,
		except in the occasions where you actually mean taxonomic species, like `tax_glom(x, "species")`.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.33
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Revise taxglom() such that it handles phyloseq and taxonomyTable classes,
		throws warning otherwise. It should not take a manually-produced character
		vector, as this is roughly equivalent to functionality supported in other method,
		especially prune_species()/merge_species().

	- Also added unit-tests and executable examples for taxglom().
		Got rid of taxglom.internal, incorporated directly into taxglom().
		taxglom() is no longer an S4-method, and 
		doesn't need to be now that the character-vector argument option is omitted,
		with S4-class handling delegated to merge_species().
		Updated "taxTab<-" to be S4 assignment, clearer handling of taxonomy Table assignments,
		especially useful for taxglom.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.29
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Add unit tests and example files for import_biom (as well as import("biom",...) ).

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.28
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Added rarefy_even_depth() function for random subsampling of microbiome samples to the same number of reads. 
		Default uses the minimum total reads among the samples in the dataset. This is based on the core "sample" function, 
		which can have its random number generator fixed by set.seed for reproducibility.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.27
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Fix bug in plot_ordination that caused an error rather than produce unannotated plots when sampleData absent in the input.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.23-26
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Added unit tests and bugfixes

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.19-22
-------------------------

		like the HMPv35 dataset, for example, while also providing useful status messages
		during non-trivial imports that might take 10 minutes or more to complete.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.18
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Added replicate labels as a "Sample" factor in the soilrep dataset.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.17
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- Fix possible bug that results from the latest version (0.6+) of igraph not being backward compatible. 
		A stable igraph0 package is available on CRAN as a stop-gap, and so all igraph dependencies were migrated
		to "igraph0" until the phyloseq-source can be updated to match the igraph latest.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.15
-------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	- plot_heatmap: Added default (but adjustable) threshold to omit taxa/sample labels
