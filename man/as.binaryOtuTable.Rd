\alias{as.binaryOtuTable}
\title{Transform the otu_table of a \code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object into a binary otu_table. Usefull to test if the results are not biaised by sequences bias that appended during PCR or NGS pipeline.}
\usage{
as.binaryOtuTable(physeq, minNumber = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{(Required): a \code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object.}

\item{minNumber}{(default = 1): the minimum number of sequences to put 
a 1 in the otu table.}
}
\value{
A \code{physeq} object with only 0/1 in the OTU table
}
\description{
Transform the otu_table of a \code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object into a binary otu_table. Usefull to test if the results are not biaised by sequences bias that appended during PCR or NGS pipeline.
