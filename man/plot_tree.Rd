\usage{
plot_tree(physeq, method = "sampledodge", nodelabf = NULL, color = NULL,
  shape = NULL, size = NULL, min.abundance = Inf, label.tips = NULL,
  text.size = NULL, sizebase = 5, base.spacing = 0.02,
  ladderize = FALSE, plot.margin = 0.2, title = NULL, treetheme = NULL,
  justify = "jagged")
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{(Required). The data about which you want to 
plot and annotate a phylogenetic tree, in the form of a
single instance of the \code{\link{phyloseq-class}}, containing at 
minimum a phylogenetic tree component (try \code{\link{phy_tree}}).
One of the major advantages of this function over basic tree-plotting utilities
in the \code{\link{ape}}-package is the ability to easily annotate the tree
with sample variables and taxonomic information. For these uses, 
the \code{physeq} argument should also have a \code{\link{sample_data}}
and/or \code{\link{tax_table}} component(s).}

\item{method}{(Optional). Character string. Default \code{"sampledodge"}. 
The name of the annotation method to use. 
This will be expanded in future versions.
Currently only \code{"sampledodge"} and \code{"treeonly"} are supported.
The \code{"sampledodge"} option results in points
drawn next to leaves if individuals from that taxa were observed,
and a separate point is drawn for each sample.}

\item{nodelabf}{(Optional). A function. Default \code{NULL}.
If \code{NULL}, the default, a function will be selected for you based upon
whether or not there are node labels in \code{phy_tree(physeq)}.
For convenience, the phyloseq package includes two generator functions
for adding arbitrary node labels (can be any character string),
\code{\link{nodeplotdefault}};
as well as for adding bootstrap values in a certain range,
\code{\link{nodeplotboot}}.
To not have any node labels in the graphic, set this argument to
\code{\link{nodeplotblank}}.}

\item{color}{(Optional). Character string. Default \code{NULL}.
The name of the variable in \code{physeq} to map to point color.
Supported options here also include the reserved special variables
of \code{\link{psmelt}}.}

\item{shape}{(Optional). Character string. Default \code{NULL}.
The name of the variable in \code{physeq} to map to point shape.
Supported options here also include the reserved special variables
of \code{\link{psmelt}}.}

\item{size}{(Optional). Character string. Default \code{NULL}.
The name of the variable in \code{physeq} to map to point size.
A special argument \code{"abundance"} is reserved here and scales
point size using abundance in each sample on a log scale.
Supported options here also include the reserved special variables
of \code{\link{psmelt}}.}

\item{min.abundance}{(Optional). Numeric. 
The minimum number of individuals required to label a point
with the precise number.
Default is \code{Inf},
meaning that no points will have their abundance labeled.
If a vector, only the first element is used.}

\item{label.tips}{(Optional). Character string. Default is \code{NULL},
indicating that no tip labels will be printed.
If \code{"taxa_names"}, then the name of the taxa will be added 
to the tree; either next to the leaves, or next to
the set of points that label the leaves. Alternatively,
if this is one of the rank names (from \code{rank_names(physeq)}),
then the identity (if any) for that particular taxonomic rank
is printed instead.}

\item{text.size}{(Optional). Numeric. Should be positive. The 
size parameter used to control the text size of taxa labels.
Default is \code{NULL}. If left \code{NULL}, this function
will automatically calculate a (hopefully) optimal text size
given the vertical constraints posed by the tree itself. 
This argument is included in case the 
automatically-calculated size is wrong, and you want to change it.
Note that this parameter is only meaningful if \code{label.tips}
is not \code{NULL}.}

\item{sizebase}{(Optional). Numeric. Should be positive.
The base of the logarithm used
to scale point sizes to graphically represent abundance of
species in a given sample. Default is 5.}

\item{base.spacing}{(Optional). Numeric. Default is \code{0.02}.
Should be positive.
This defines the base-spacing between points at each tip/leaf in the
the tree. The larger this value, the larger the spacing between points.
This is useful if you have problems with overlapping large points
and/or text indicating abundance, for example. Similarly, if you 
don't have this problem and want tighter point-spacing, you can 
shrink this value.}

\item{ladderize}{(Optional). Boolean or character string (either
\code{FALSE}, \code{TRUE}, or \code{"left"}).
Default is \code{FALSE}.
This parameter specifies whether or not to \code{\link[ape]{ladderize}} the tree 
(i.e., reorder nodes according to the depth of their enclosed
subtrees) prior to plotting.
This tends to make trees more aesthetically pleasing and legible in
a graphical display.
When \code{TRUE} or \code{"right"}, ``right'' ladderization is used.
When set to \code{FALSE}, no ladderization is applied.
When set to \code{"left"}, the reverse direction
(``left'' ladderization) is applied.
This argument is passed on to \code{\link{tree_layout}}.}

\item{plot.margin}{(Optional). Numeric. Default is \code{0.2}.
Should be positive.
This defines how much right-hand padding to add to the tree plot,
which can be required to not truncate tip labels. The margin value
is specified as a fraction of the overall tree width which is added
to the right side of the plot area. So a value of \code{0.2} adds
twenty percent extra space to the right-hand side of the plot.}

\item{title}{(Optional). Default \code{NULL}. Character string.
The main title for the graphic.}

\item{treetheme}{(Optional).
A custom \code{\link{ggplot}}2 \code{\link[ggplot2]{theme}} layer
to use for the tree. Supplants any default theme layers 
used within the function.
A value of \code{NULL} uses a default, minimal-annotations theme. 
If anything other than a them or \code{NULL}, the current global ggplot2
theme will result.}

\item{justify}{(Optional). A character string indicating the
type of justification to use on dodged points and tip labels. 
A value of \code{"jagged"}, the default, results in 
these tip-mapped elements being spaced as close to the tips as possible
without gaps. 
Currently, any other value for \code{justify} results in
a left-justified arrangement of both labels and points.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{ggplot}}2 plot.

\description{
There are many useful examples of phyloseq tree graphics in the
\href{http://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/plot_tree-examples}{phyloseq online tutorials}.
This function is intended to facilitate easy graphical investigation of 
the phylogenetic tree, as well as sample data. Note that for phylogenetic
sequencing of samples with large richness, some of the options in this 
function will be prohibitively slow to render, or too dense to be
interpretable. A rough ``rule of thumb'' is to use subsets of data 
with not many more than 200 OTUs per plot, sometimes less depending on the
complexity of the additional annotations being mapped to the tree. It is 
usually possible to create an unreadable, uninterpretable tree with modern
datasets. However, the goal should be toward parameter settings and data
subsets that convey (honestly, accurately) some biologically relevant
feature of the data. One of the goals of the \code{\link{phyloseq-package}}
is to make the determination of these features/settings as easy as possible.

\details{
This function received an early development contribution from the work of 
Gregory Jordan via \href{https://github.com/gjuggler/ggphylo}{the ggphylo package}.
\code{plot_tree} has since been re-written.
For details see \code{\link{tree_layout}}.
