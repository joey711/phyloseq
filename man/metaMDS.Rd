\title{S3 class placeholder definition (list) for metaMDS}
\format{An object of class \code{metaMDS} of length 0.}
\usage{
metaMDS
}
\description{
The ape package does export a version of its \code{\link[vegan]{metaMDS}}-class,
partly because it is not really defined formally anywhere.
Instead, it is an S3 class extended from the base class, \code{\link{list}} --
this is a very common and easy approach --
and proper behavior of any method taking an instance of this class 
requires exact naming conventions for element names of the list components.
The phyloseq package does not provide any validity checks that a given phylo
instance is valid (conforms to the conventions in the ape package)... yet.
If problems arise, this might be considered, and they could be defined
judiciously and within phyloseq.
