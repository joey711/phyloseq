\name{intersect_taxa}
\alias{intersect_taxa}
\title{Returns the intersection of species and samples for the components of x}
\usage{
intersect_taxa(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(Required). A \code{\link{phyloseq-class}} object
that contains 2 or more components
that in-turn describe species/taxa.}
}
\value{
Returns a character vector of only those species that are present in
 all species-describing components of \code{x}.
}
\description{
This function is used internally as part of the infrastructure to ensure that
component data types in a phyloseq-object have exactly the same taxa/species.
It relies heavily on the \code{\link{Reduce}} function to determine the 
strictly common species.

#
## data(GlobalPatterns)
## head(intersect_taxa(GlobalPatterns), 10)
