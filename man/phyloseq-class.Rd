\title{The main experiment-level class for phyloseq data}
\description{
Contains all currently-supported component data classes: 
\code{\link{otu_table-class}},
\code{\link{sample_data-class}},
\code{\link{taxonomyTable-class}} (\code{"tax_table"} slot),
\code{\link[ape]{phylo}}-class (\code{"phy_tree"} slot),
and the \code{\link[Biostrings]{XStringSet-class}} (\code{"refseq"} slot).
There are several advantages
to storing your phylogenetic sequencing experiment as an instance of the
phyloseq class, not the least of which is that it is easy to return to the
data later and feel confident that the different data types ``belong'' to
one another. Furthermore, the \code{\link{phyloseq}} constructor ensures that
the different data components have compatible indices (e.g. OTUs and samples),
and performs the necessary trimming automatically when you create your
``experiment-level'' object. Downstream analyses are aware of which data
classes they require -- and where to find them -- often making your 
\code{phyloseq-class} object the only data argument required for analysis and plotting
functions (although there are many options and parameter arguments available
to you).
}
\details{
In the case of missing component data, the slots are set to \code{NULL}. As
soon as a \code{phyloseq-class} object is to be updated with new component
data (previously missing/\code{NULL} or not), the indices of all components
are re-checked for compatibility and trimmed if necessary. This is to ensure
by design that components describe the same taxa/samples, and also that these
trimming/validity checks do not need to be repeated in downstream analyses.

slots:
\describe{
   \item{otu_table}{a single object of class otu_table.}
   \item{sam_data}{ a single object of class sample_data.}
   \item{tax_table}{ a single object of class taxonomyTable.}
   \item{phy_tree}{ a single object of the \code{\link[ape]{phylo}}-class, from the ape package.}
   \item{refseq}{ a biological sequence set object of a class that
        inherits from the \code{\link[Biostrings]{XStringSet-class}}, from the Biostrings package.}
}
