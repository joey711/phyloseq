\title{Parse mothur group file into a simple hash table.}
\usage{
import_mothur_groups(mothur_group_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{mothur_group_file}{A character string indicating the location of the 
\emph{mothur}-produced group file in which the sample-source of each sequence
is recorded. See 
\code{http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Make.group}}
}
\value{
A data.frame that is effectively a hash table between sequence names
 and their sample source.
}
\description{
The data.frame object
returned by this function is not immediately useable by other \emph{phyloseq}
functions, and must be first parsed in conjunction with a separate \emph{mothur}
\code{"list"} file. This function is made accessible to \emph{phyloseq} users
for troubleshooting and inspection, but the \code{link{import_mothur()}} function
is suggested if the goal is to import the OTU clustering results from \emph{mothur}
into \emph{phyloseq}. You will need both a group file and a list file for that end.
