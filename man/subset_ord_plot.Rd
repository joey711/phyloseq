\title{Subset points from an ordination-derived ggplot}
\usage{
subset_ord_plot(p, threshold=0.05, method="farthest")
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{(Required).  A \code{\link{ggplot}} object created by 
\code{\link{plot_ordination}}. It contains the complete data that you
want to subset.}

\item{threshold}{(Optional). A numeric scalar. Default is \code{0.05}.
This value determines a coordinate threshold or population threshold,
depending on the value of the \code{method} argument, ultimately 
determining which points are included in returned \code{data.frame}.}

\item{method}{(Optional). A character string. One of 
 \code{c("farthest", "radial", "square")}. Default is \code{"farthest"}.
 This determines how threshold will be interpreted.

\describe{

   \item{farthest}{
      Unlike the other two options, this option implies removing a 
      certain fraction or number of points from the plot, depending
      on the value of \code{threshold}. If \code{threshold} is greater
      than or equal to \code{1}, then all but \code{threshold} number 
      of points farthest from the origin are removed. Otherwise, if
      \code{threshold} is less than \code{1}, all but \code{threshold}
      fraction of points farthests from origin are retained.
   }

   \item{radial}{
     Keep only those points that are beyond \code{threshold} 
      radial distance from the origin. Has the effect of removing a
      circle of points from the plot, centered at the origin.
   }

   \item{square}{
        Keep only those points with at least one coordinate
        greater than \code{threshold}. Has the effect of removing a 
        ``square'' of points from the plot, centered at the origin.
   }

 }}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{data.frame}} suitable for creating a 
 \code{\link{ggplot}} plot object, graphically summarizing
 the ordination result according to previously-specified parameters.
}
\description{
Easily retrieve a plot-derived \code{data.frame} with a subset of points
according to a threshold and method. The meaning of the threshold depends
upon the method. See argument description below.
