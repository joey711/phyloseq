\title{Import mothur list and group files and return an otu_table}
\usage{
import_mothur_otu_table(mothur_list_file, mothur_group_file, cutoff=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mothur_list_file}{The list file name and/or location as produced by \emph{mothur}.}

\item{mothur_group_file}{The name/location of the group file produced 
by \emph{mothur}'s \code{make.group()} function. It contains information
about the sample source of individual sequences, necessary for creating a
species/taxa abundance table (\code{otu_table}). See
\code{http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Make.group}}

\item{cutoff}{A character string indicating the cutoff value, (or \code{"unique"}), 
that matches one of the cutoff-values used to produce the OTU clustering 
results contained within the list-file created by \emph{mothur} (and specified
by the \code{mothur_list_file} argument). 
The default
is to take the largest value among the cutoff values contained in the list
file. If only one cutoff is included in the file, it is taken and this
argument does not need to be specified. Note that the \code{cluster()}
function within the \emph{mothur} package will often produce a list file
with multiple cutoff values, even if a specific cutoff is specified. It is
suggested that you check which cutoff values are available in a given list
file using the \code{\link{show_mothur_cutoffs}} function.}
}
\value{
An \code{\link{otu_table}} object.
